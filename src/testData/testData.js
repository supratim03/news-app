Additionally, Beyoncé and British girl group Flo were the only artists of colour to take home prizes on the night.

Except, one suspects, solving the Brits’ most obvious problem. We live in an age when pop’s primary audience of teens and young twentysomethings simply aren’t going to sit down and watch a two-and-a-bit-hour award ceremony on live TV: viewing doesn’t work like that any more.</p> \n<p>How moving the Brits to a Saturday was supposed to lure its target market away from social media and on-demand streaming – or indeed just going out with their mates – is an intriguing question. You rather got the feeling that most of this years’ viewers might have been old enough to remember the days when the Brits seemed to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/annie-lennox-30-greatest-songs-ranked\">Annie Lennox</a> an award every year, and that they might have spent the evening asking “who’s that?” whenever 2023’s stars appeared. Which can’t possibly be the Brits’ desired effect.</p>"
