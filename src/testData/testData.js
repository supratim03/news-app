Additionally, Beyoncé and British girl group Flo were the only artists of colour to take home prizes on the night.

Except, one suspects, solving the Brits’ most obvious problem. We live in an age when pop’s primary audience of teens and young twentysomethings simply aren’t going to sit down and watch a two-and-a-bit-hour award ceremony on live TV: viewing doesn’t work like that any more.</p> \n<p>How moving the Brits to a Saturday was supposed to lure its target market away from social media and on-demand streaming – or indeed just going out with their mates – is an intriguing question. You rather got the feeling that most of this years’ viewers might have been old enough to remember the days when the Brits seemed to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/annie-lennox-30-greatest-songs-ranked\">Annie Lennox</a> an award every year, and that they might have spent the evening asking “who’s that?” whenever 2023’s stars appeared. Which can’t possibly be the Brits’ desired effect.</p>"

It is the worst crisis, the worst earthquake that we face certainly since Nepal, probably since Haiti.”</p> \n<p>He agreed with estimates that the UN emergency coordinator Martin Griffiths gave yesterday that the death toll could hit 50,000, adding he believed it “is the right figure, I fear, that we are going to see”.</p> \n<p>He said that there was well-organised rescue operation in Turkey and “lessons have been learned” since Haiti.</p> \n<p>On the quake-hit areas of northern Syria he said it is “much more difficult to get help and relief” there and because of the lack of infrastructure in the ungoverned areas people there are in “very deep jeopardy” in below-freezing temperatures.</p> \n<p>He said that two flights had departed on Saturday night, one from RAF Brize Norton and one from Dubai taking tents and blankets to Turkey “and much of that, of course, is bound for Syria,” he added.</p> \n<p>He added:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It is in Syria that the international community is far more stretched. We were able to get through the one crossing that is open for the UN, but that crossing too was badly damaged in the earthquake and because of the Russian veto the UN cannot use the other three crossing out of Turkey into Syria.

          "bodyTextSummary": "Good morning. As the rescue efforts continue following the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, here is a summary of recent events. The death toll from Monday’s earthquake has surpassed 28,000. Turkish vice president said last night the death toll in his country had risen to 24,617. The Agence France-Presse has reported there has been 3,553 death in Syria. UN emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths said the death toll from the earthquake is likely to “more than double”, adding that he expected tens of thousands more deaths. He visited the Turkish province of Kahramanmaraş on Saturday, describing the earthquake as the “worst event in 100 years in this region” Search operations continue, and in Turkey’s southeastern province of Hatay, a Romanian rescue team carried a 35-year-old man named Mustafa down a pile of debris from a building, broadcaster CNN Turk said, about 149 hours after the quake. A spokesman for the UN secretary-general has told the BBC it was time “to put all politics aside” to deliver aid to Syria, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, added that it was “hard to imagine a more complex emergency” in Syria. The WHO’s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reportedly visited Aleppo on Saturday Turkey’s president, Tayyip Recep Erdoğan, has warned that looters will be punished after reports of people taking goods in earthquake-hit areas. Turkish authorities arrested 48 people for looting or trying to defraud victims, state media reported on Saturday. Turkish police have detained 12 people over collapsed buildings in the southeastern provinces of Gaziantep and Şanlıurfa, including building contractors, following the huge quake that hit Turkey, local media reported on Saturday.Turkish officials issued more than 100 arrest warrants in connection with the poor construction of buildings that collapsed in Monday’s earthquakes in Turkey. Facing questions over his handling of Turkey’s most devastating earthquake since 1939, President Tayyip Erdogan promised to start rebuilding within weeks, saying hundreds of thousands of buildings were wrecked. The European Union’s envoy to Syria urged Damascus not to politicise issues of humanitarian aid, rejecting accusations as “unfair” that the bloc had failed to provide sufficient help to Syrians. “It is absolutely unfair to be accused of not providing aid, when actually we have constantly been doing exactly that for over a decade and we are doing so much more even during the earthquake crisis,” Dan Stoenescu told Reuters. A border gate between Turkey and Armenia opened for the first time in 35 years on Saturday to allow aid to reach those affected in southern Turkey, state-owned Anadolu news agency and a diplomat said Turkish energy company Karadeniz Holding said on Saturday it would send two humanitarian aid ships that can each house 1,500 people, to help the relief effort in the southern province of Hatay, Turkey, Reuters reports",
